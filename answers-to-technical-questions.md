1. I spent 5 hours doing this test. I decided to do it in ReactJS, due to the fact that I hadn't used ReactJS in a long time and wanted a refresher. Therefore, there was a little bit of a learning curve. If I were to spend more time on this solution, I would add more styling. More importantly, I would figure out a way to paginate the data requested by city, so that the webpage was more performance driven. Lastly, I would allow users to filter results based on price, or how far they were from the restaurants.


2. Maybe not the most useful feature but definitely the one that I enjoyed looking at the most was react-boostrap. It was really interesting to see how the components I had seen in bootstrap were remade to fix into the react lifestyle.

3. I have not had much experience with tracking performance issues. However, common places I would look would be in the source when a page is loading, and also within the build output. For my personal website I have been working on, the compressed file size is too large. Getting down those values will help with my performance and how quickly the page loads.

4. The API was really interesting to use, but it was surprising that you could access it without authentication. This is something that I would improve upon.
